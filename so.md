[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a primary tool that web developers around the world rely on every day in their work. As a W3C Developer Advocate, monitoring what questions get raised on the technologies you're responsible for can help identify gap in what the specs cover, or in challenges developers face when adopting them. You can also support developers by helping to add good answers to Stack Overflow.

There are two key ways you can find questions at Stack Overflow to answer:

* Use Stack Overflow’s [search page](https://stackoverflow.com/search) to search for feature names from the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate.

* Subscribe to particular Stack Overflow tags.

The [Adoption Monitor](https://dontcallmedom.github.io/adoption-monitor/) has identified a number of [tags and keywords associated to W3C specifications](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/adoption-monitor/blob/main/spec-filters.json).
