[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is, along with Stack Overflow, a primary tool that web developers around the world rely on every day in their work. As a W3C Developer Advocate, you can support developers by helping to improve MDN content, which in turn helps with bringing visibility on the said technologies, a key first step in getting more direct adoption and feedback.

[MDN content](https://github.com/mdn/content) is managed in a GitHub repo. So the tasks involved in improving MDN content include:

* Write new MDN documentation for features defined in the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate, and raise pull requests in the [MDN content](https://github.com/mdn/content) repo to get your contributions added to MDN.
  The README file in the MDN content repo [provides detailed guidance](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/README.md#making-contributions) on how to make content contributions to MDN.

* Monitor [the list of open issues](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues) in the MDN content repo, looking for any issues related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find an issue which you’ve got the ability to resolve, post a comment to the issue asking that it be assigned to you, and then create a pull request with an MDN content change that resolves the issue.

* Monitor [the list of open pull requests](https://github.com/mdn/content/pulls) in the MDN content repo, looking for any pull requests related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find a pull request which you’ve got the domain knowledge (technical knowledge) to help review, then review the PR changes, and post a comment.
