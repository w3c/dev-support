Social Media, in particular Twitter (for a large part of the technical community), provides a good platform to seek input on technology design questions groups may have, get early feedback on specific directions, and grow the community of contributors willing to help with promoting or facilitating adoption of our technologies.

W3C Developer Advocates may consider the following actions:
* watch feeds based on hashtags linked to their technology (e.g. #CSS)
* animate a Twitter account linked to the relevant group (e.g. [@csswg](https://twitter.com/csswg)) - this might be used to announce e.g. new specifications, new release of specifications, etc
* call for input on design discussions their group is having. Before announcing github issues directly, be mindful that this won't be disruptive to the group's discussion flow
